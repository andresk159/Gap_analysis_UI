### **Calculate cost distance raster**

***

This function creates two files:

1. __Shapefile of occurrence:__ it is a spatial format for the latitude and longitude of each accession in the database, it can be found in *results/"crop\_name"/"region\_name"/"race\_name"/occurrences/ Occ.shp*
2. __Cost distance raster:__ It is a raster file where each pixel is computed from the friction surface and the occurrence shapefile created before,  
as the cost of movement from each pixel in the friction raster to the nearest occurrence. The output file is saved in *results/"crop\_name"/"region\_name"/"race\_name"/gap\_scores/resources/cost_dist.tif*
